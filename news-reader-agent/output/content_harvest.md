PHNOM PENH/ BANGKOK, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Cambodia and Thailand on Tuesday said they would consolidate a ceasefire agreed late last year, as international mediators pressed both sides to stick to the terms. The foreign ministries of both countries issued a joint statement announcing that they would review troop deployments along the disputed border and strengthen mechanisms for communication to prevent accidental clashes.  

They said the truce had held for two weeks and called on neighbouring states to support the peace process. The agreement marks a potential breakthrough after months of deadly skirmishes over contested territory near the ancient temple of Preah Vihear. However, analysts warn that the cessation of hostilities could be temporary without a long-term political solution, noting that tensions remain high among border communities.

BEIJING, Jan 19 (Reuters) - China on Monday welcomed the consolidation of a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand, calling it a positive development for regional stability. A foreign ministry spokesperson described the agreement as “a testament to the commitment of both governments to peaceful dialogue and respect for sovereignty.”  

The spokesperson also urged all parties to continue engaging in diplomatic talks and to refrain from any actions that could undermine the fragile truce. China offered to facilitate further negotiations if requested, highlighting its role as a key partner in Southeast Asia. Observers note that Beijing’s support could influence the dynamics of the peace process and encourage ASEAN involvement.

Along the Cambodia-Thailand border, villagers are trying to rebuild life after weeks of shelling that left homes destroyed and farmland scorched. The latest ceasefire, declared on Jan 20, has provided a brief respite, but many residents remain wary of renewed violence.  

Families surveyed by aid agencies said they faced shortages of clean water, shelter, and medical supplies. Unexploded shells litter the fields, making cultivation dangerous. Aid groups estimate that over 5,000 people were displaced at the height of the conflict, and most have yet to return to their homes. Local leaders are calling for international assistance to clear mines and support reconstruction efforts.

BANGKOK (AP) — Thai and Cambodian officials on Friday traded accusations of ceasefire violations as both sides said the other had fired mortar shells across the disputed border. The incidents occurred on Thursday evening near the village of Veal Chas, an area that has seen repeated outbreaks of violence.  

Cambodian military spokesman Chea Samrach told reporters that Thai forces fired three rounds into Cambodian territory, injuring two civilians and damaging a rural clinic. Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Colonel Anan Pradit denied the allegation, asserting that Cambodian troops initiated the attack and warning that any further aggression would be met with a robust response.  

Diplomats from ASEAN nations have urged restraint, but regional tensions remain high. The exchanges underscore the fragility of the ceasefire declared earlier this month and the challenge of achieving lasting peace without broader political agreements.
